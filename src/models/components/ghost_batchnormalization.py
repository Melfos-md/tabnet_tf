class GhostBatchNormalization(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    """
    Implements the Ghost Batch Normalization technique.

    Reference: Hoffer, E.; Hubara, I.; and Soudry, D. 2017. Train longer,
    generalize better: closing the generalization gap in large batch
    training of neural networks. arXiv:1705.08741 .

    Ghost Batch Normalization (GBN) divides a larger batch into smaller virtual batches and 
    performs batch normalization on each smaller batch. This allows for larger overall batch 
    sizes during training while using batch normalization, which is usually sensitive to batch size.

    A design choice made here is to force user to choose a virtual batch size that divides the batch size without any remainder.

    WARNING: There is no check if batch_size attribute match the actual `inputs` shape since I did not found a solution to check it in graph mode.

    Attributes:
    - virtual_batch_size (int): Size of each virtual batch.
    - momentum (float): Momentum for the moving average in batch normalization.
    - epsilon (float): Small constant added for numerical stability in batch normalization.
    - bn_layers (List[tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization]): List of cached batch normalization layers.
    
    Methods:
    - call(inputs, training=None): Applies ghost batch normalization on the inputs.
